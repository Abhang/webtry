                    <section class="mb-5">
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        I recently had a discussion about a very mainstrem
                        geopolitical issue, and the very pious ones also took the
                        other side - the harsh one. They agreed that mass killing is
                        justified.
                      </p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        I wonder what is the meaning of being religious? I always
                        thought it is about having peace within, and looking at
                        fellow beings with love. It also means that one is just in
                        day to day lives and bigger topics that matter. However, I
                        realized that it is not the case. Most people are religious
                        for a sense of community, for a sense of belonging to part
                        of a larger group, and it has nothing to do with the
                        teachings of religion. Though they pray and say good stuff
                        as part of it, and they know the deeper meanings of the
                        religious texts, but unfortunately they dont practice what
                        they preach.
                      </p>
                      <p class="fst-italic fs-5 mb-4">
                        What is the use of practicing religion this way? How does it
                        help make the world a better place?
                      </p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        It makes the world of the believer a bit better by inducing
                        a false security that the god is all powerful and protects.
                        This is contradictory to the belif that only riteous people
                        are proctected, however contradiction is unbeknowest to them
                        as they truely believe they are riteous, when they are not!
                      </p>
                      <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        There is no meaning of such pious practice. How can a mind
                        full of delusion decieve god? How can god (the all powerful)
                        ignore the hypocrisy of the flawd following?
                      </p>

                        The collective delusion of a mass of followers is not
                        uncommon. It is very often in India that we see religious
                        conferences spewing venom, and the scriptures never support
                        such organizing. However, to depict every individual in such
                        a gathering - passions are high, every single person thinks
                        the right thing is being done, and that this activity will
                        liberate them all.
