                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    I recently had a discussion about a very mainstrem
                    geopolitical issue, and the very pious ones also took the
                    other side - the harsh one. They agreed that mass killing is
                    justified.
                  </p>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    I wonder what is the meaning of being religious? I always
                    thought it is about having peace within, and looking at
                    fellow beings with love. It also means that one is just in
                    day to day lives and bigger topics that matter. However, I
                    realized that it is not the case. Most people are religious
                    for a sense of community, for a sense of belonging to part
                    of a larger group, and it has nothing to do with the
                    teachings of religion. Though they pray and say good stuff
                    as part of it, and they know the deeper meanings of the
                    religious texts, but unfortunately they dont practice what
                    they preach.
                  </p>
                  <p class="fst-italic fs-5 mb-4">
                    What is the use of practicing religion this way? How does it
                    help make the world a better place?
                  </p>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    It makes the world of the believer a bit better by inducing
                    a false security that the god is all powerful and protects.
                    This is contradictory to the belief that only riteous people
                    are proctected, however contradiction is unbeknowest to them
                    as they truely believe they are riteous, when they are not!
                  </p>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    There is no meaning of such pious practice. How can a mind
                    full of delusion decieve god? How can god (the all powerful)
                    ignore the hypocrisy of the flawd following?
                  </p>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    The collective delusion of a mass of followers is not
                    uncommon. It is very often in India that we see religious
                    conferences spewing venom, and the scriptures never support
                    such organizing. However, to depict every individual in such
                    a gathering - passions are high, every single person thinks
                    the right thing is being done, and that this activity will
                    liberate them all.

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                      The result is that there is a big religious divide.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                      Jews and Arabs, Hindus and Muslims, Blacks and Whites, and
                      many more. I wonder what would a world without such
                      divisions look like? It is possible that human race would
                      then create new demarcation - similar to rich and poor,
                      urban and rural etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-5">Maybe we are hardwired to divide and
                      always have a villan on the other end? Maybe we will always have a divide.</p>
