With the new leadership in Syria, what happens to the middle east? 
It is quite a turnaround, in a very quick fashion, Al-Assad was gone, and there was a new guy at the throne, Abu Mohammed Al-Jawlani. A terrorist as per the UN, the US and others, now heads a state. 

But people of Syria see a new hope, a redemption, a sunrise. Al-Jawlani is the new hope. ***What is the future going to be?***

As per what the UN Security Council reads (as on the time of this writing) -

> Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani is the leader of Al-Nusrah Front for the
> People of the Levant (QDe.137) a.k.a Jabhat al-Nusrah, a Syria-based
> terrorist group previously listed between 30 May 2013 and 13 May 2014
> as an alias of Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115). In 2011 Abu Bakr
> al-Baghdadi, listed as Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai
> (QDi.299), instructed Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani to establish a front for
> Al-Qaida in Iraq in Syria by developing a local presence and fighting.
> Al-Qaida in Iraq supplied Jabhat al-Nusrah with manpower, money,
> weapons and advice.
> 
> The formation of Jabhat al-Nusrah, featuring Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani,
> was announced on 23 January 2012. Abu Mohammed stated that the group
> consisted of fighters from the Near East.
> 
> In a statement issued in late May 2012 by Jabhat al-Nusrah’s media
> outlet Al-Manara Al-Baydh'a Media Foundation (the White Minaret), Abu
> Mohammed al-Jawlani was referred to as “the supervisor general for
> Jabhat al-Nusrah”. He called on his followers in Jabhat al-Nusrah to
> carry out attacks in revenge for a reported massacre in Houla, Syria,
> and urged the populations of the Levant to unite under his movement.
> Many of the attacks carried out by Jabhat al-Nusrah under the command
> of Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani have caused the deaths of civilians.
> 
> In a statement released on 10 April 2013, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani
> confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gave Jabhat al-Nusrah considerable
> support, and that Abu Bakr had deputised Abu Mohammed to run the
> Al-Qaida fight in Syria. Abu Mohammed declared that it was his
> intention to establish a state in the Levant region (not just Syria)
> through violent means. Abu Mohammed asserted his pride in the banner
> of Al-Qaida in Iraq. Abu Mohammed pledged his and his organisation's
> allegiance to Aiman Muhammed Rabi al-Zawahiri (QDi.006), the head of
> the international Al-Qaida umbrella movement and deferred to his
> guidance.
> 
> Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani's media statements have been published by the
> same internet sites that host authentic Al-Qaida media. In June 2013,
> the leader of Al-Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, confirmed in a letter to
> Abu Bakr and Abu Mohammed that Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani is in charge of
> Jabhat al-Nusrah.
> 
> Jabhat al-Nusrah operates in Syria where it has carried out a number
> of terrorist attacks.
