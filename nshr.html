                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Hi Chinnu,</p>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    As you step into this new world, the other side of the
                    Earth, don't get surprized by how people act differently.
                    You might find people who are very different, whose problems
                    and perspectives are very different, and whose life
                    challenges have been completely alien to us. Growing up in
                    India is a very different experience, and us Indians have
                    very different challenges, while Americans never have had to
                    think about those problems at all, they might even wonder at
                    your problems.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">
                    As you move to the great USA, here are three things I wish
                    you always keep close to your heart:
                  </h2>
                  <h3 class="fst-italic mb-4">
                    You are Amazing, and better than everyone else out there.
                  </h3>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    It is not without enough thought that I say so, but, behind
                    that is a lot of reasoning and evidence. Out of all the
                    people in the world, it was you, who has been chosen for
                    that role. You carry a personality, which others only dream
                    of. Please remember that you are amazing effortlessly. Never
                    try to be like others when you step into America, thinking
                    that you have to blend in a new culture. No! You are your
                    own brand, and others will try to be like you if you don't
                    try to blend in! (Don't believe me? See it yourself!) Always
                    remember, you are the most amazing person there is in Amex,
                    and trust your own decisions more than others.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <h3 class="fst-italic mb-4">
                    You are meant for bigger things, be bold and refuse bleh
                    work.
                  </h3>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    As you are a very sweet person (just like me :p ), we tend
                    to not say no 'enough'. I wish you say no when you know you
                    wont benefit from something. You dont always have to be
                    sweet to people. People who are less predictable are less
                    often harmed in office politics and other weird things
                    people like us don't like to get into. Be brave, trust your
                    skills, you don't need to prove your worth, it is already
                    out there everyday! You are not meant to do petty things, so
                    always refuse bad work.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <h3 class="fst-italic mb-4">
                    Explore the world. Explore different cultures.
                  </h3>
                  <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    You have worked very hard all your life, but, now is the
                    time to enjoy a bit too. Work when you are working, but
                    other time, enjoy your life. Go to those parties, go to the
                    walks in the parks, go join that reading club in the
                    library. Do everything you have dreamt of doing. Do not shy
                    away from travelling for visiting that spot for eating that
                    sandwitch. Make friends from different cultures, and spend
                    time with them, eat their food, explore their festivals!
                    Enjoy every bit! Your bf will always support you in whatever
                    you choose to do.
                  </p>
